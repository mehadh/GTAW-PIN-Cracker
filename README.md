# GTAW-PIN-Cracker
A Python script that wardials 4 digit pins into the CEF phone on GTA:World until it finds the right one.

In essence, this is a simple war dialer going in a sequential range from 0000-9999. Statistically, it should take about 3 hours to unlock a phone, however the maximum amount of time to unlock one phone would be 6 hours.

In order to use this script, you will need to be able to find coordinates on your screen to reconfigure the positions of everything. I use [this](http://breakthrusoftware.com/html/onlinedocs/kb/installkb/ScreenCoordTool.html) simple tool. 

Do keep in mind that in order to use this script, you must be running the RAGE:MP client, and the script will use your cursor, so you can not use your PC in the meanwhile.
